### Outline
The COVID-19 pandemic was a major public health crisis that began in 2020. It shut down most of the world for 2-3 years and its impacts are still being studied today. The United States had a disjointed response to the pandemic that varied by State and, in some cases, Municipality. The United States recorded its first laboratory confirmed case of 2019 Novel Coronavirus on January 20, 2020 in Washington state. The country then declared a national emergency on March 13, 2020. The following months saw cases and deaths attributed to the virus increase exponentionally. After the initial wave, new viral variants would emerge, causing waves of new infections, hospitalizations and deaths. The first COVID-19 vaccine was administered in the U.S. on December 14, 2020. The pandemic raged on over the following two years in an ebb and flow pattern. On April 10, 2023, the United States ended the national emergency declaration. And on May 5, 2023, the World Health Organization declared the end of the pandemic phase.

Our project focuses on the pandemic's economic impact in the years of 2020-2023 in five states: California, Florida, Texas, Washington and New York. We chose these states based on their differing approaches to public health policy during the first years of the pandemic. In the section below, we rank the states based on the number of restricitons they set in place to curb viral transmission, with Florida having the least restrictions, followed by Texas. Washington, New York and California had similar policies in place, with only slight differences in duration of policy.

## Research Questions

Our main question centers on whether the states with less COVID-19 restrictions (Florida and Texas) have better economic outcomes than the states with the stricter measures (California, New York, Washington). We will review GDP, unemployment, and per capital Personal Income.
  - How was GDP in these states affected through the years of 2020-2023? Did Florida and Texas perform better?
  - What were the unemployment patterns for these states during these years? Did Florida and Texas perform better in this metric?
  - Is there a relationship between GDP and Unemployment in these states?
  - How did the pandemic affect Personal Income per capita in these states? Was there a notable difference?
